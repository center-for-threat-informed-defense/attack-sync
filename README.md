# ATT&CK Sync

ATT&CK Sync is a Center for Threat-Informed Defense project that aims to ease the
process of staying in sync with MITRE ATT&CK速 version updates. We recognize widespread
difficulties keeping internal systems and date in sync with with ATT&CK, so this project
includes tools, data, and methodology to reduce the cost and effort associated with
tracking ATT&CK releases. The Center is deploying this technology to improve our own
projects, and we believe it will be highly valuable to many other organizations as well.

## Getting Started

The best way to get started is to visit the ATT&CK Sync website, where you can quickly
access detailed changelogs that show cumulative differences between any two versions of
ATT&CK from v8.0 to v13.0. The sample JSON changelog shows how the differences can be
consumed in machine-readable format, and the sample Excel mappings show how the
machine-readable data can be merged with your internal systems & data to provide
contextual ATT&CK changes. Finally, the project wiki provides thorough documentation for
the project as well as a case study.

## Getting Involved

There are several ways that you can get involved with this project and help
advance threat-informed defense:

- **Visit the ATT&CK Sync website.** Access changelogs that detail the cumulative
  changes between any ATT&CK versions. This is especially helpful if your organization
  is contemplating an upgrade of internal systems to a more recent version of ATT&CK.
- **Review the sample documents.** These documents will give you a better idea of how
  ATT&CK Sync can your organization major time and effort while staying in sync with
  ATT&CK.
- **Tell us what you think.** As the project grows, we want to cover a broader set of
  use cases. Let us know if you like this idea and how we can make it even better in
  future releases.
